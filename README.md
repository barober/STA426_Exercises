## This is exercise 1

Getting to know git and gitHub, as well as creating a README.md markdown file. 

Here are some resources for markdown:

- Very basic markdown options: [commonmark basics](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- More extensive, but not useable for README.md files if I am not mistaken?: [gitHub flavored markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html)
